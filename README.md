pattern.js
==========

A PEG-based pattern matching parser generator

pattern.js iherits ideas from [LPEG](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/) and OMeta (http://tinlizzie.org/ometa/).  The interface largely follows that of LPEG, differing mainly where JavaScript and Lua diverge in terms of functionality. pattern.js can be used to generate string parsers as well as match patterns within hierarchical data structures.
